# TODO:
> Create priority job queue
> Reenable crypto seed init (segfaults now, known zig issue)
> Extract smiley app from backend
  > Make broadcast / direct message api, then app interprets payload itself
  > Make job queue general so you can supply a struct
  > Create separate job queue for drawing, app logic

# Next: (small) steps selected with priority to make progress.

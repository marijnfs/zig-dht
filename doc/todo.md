# TODO:


# Next: (small) steps selected with priority to make progress.
- Make printing of messages work, use log level to turn off logging
- Figure out strange bug when adding two jobs in readline.zig next to each other (causes some race condition?)
- Play with notcurses (first with just c perhaps, get a feel if it's worth it)
- Commit pull request to zig to get rid of unreachables in std.net ip stuff

# Backlog:
- rendering with zbox based code
  - deal with input as well (done in zig-nng)


# Done
- implement timer code
- connection strategies
- communication of known ips

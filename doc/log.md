Got confused by source_id in both Message and Content, only set one of them. Thent the reply send to the unset source_id and everything failed.
Should have used debugger earlier.
Already was annoyed by two source_id's before, should remove it; don't use two variables for one thing.

added format for connection (didn't print properly yet)
